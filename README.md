### Week 4 Day 7 – CSV & JSON Data Handling in Java
- Worked on reading, writing, parsing, and validating structured data formats commonly used in real-world applications. Practiced end-to-end data handling using both core Java and popular libraries.
- Covered key concepts including:

 -   Reading and writing CSV files using BufferedReader/Writer
-   Handling CSV data efficiently with OpenCSV
-   Mapping CSV records to Java objects (CsvToBean)
-   Validating CSV fields using regex and data checks
-   Understanding JSON structure (objects, arrays, nested data)
-   Creating, reading, writing, and parsing JSON using org.json, Gson, and Jackson
-   Dynamic JSON parsing with JsonNode and JSON schema validation
