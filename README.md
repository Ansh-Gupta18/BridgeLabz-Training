super keyword to access parent class constructors and methods. Method overriding and runtime polymorphism. Accessing inherited members based on access modifiers. Understood important inheritance rules:

Constructors are not inherited. Private members are not directly accessible in child classes. Method overriding requires same method signature. final methods cannot be overridden. Implemented real-world examples such as:

### Week 3 day 4
This document covers essential Java classes for string handling, file reading, and basic searching algorithms. These are fundamental for efficient Java programming and data processing.

Topics Covered

1. StringBuilder
Mutable sequence of characters; allows modification without creating a new object.
Efficient for concatenating strings in loops or frequent modifications.
2. StringBuffer
Similar to StringBuilder but thread-safe (synchronized).
Ideal for multithreaded environments where multiple threads modify the same string.
3. FileReader
Reads character files; suitable for reading text data.
Works with BufferedReader for efficient reading of large files line by line.
4. InputStreamReader
Bridges byte streams to character streams.
Commonly used with System.in to read input from the console.
5. Linear Search
Sequentially checks each element in a list until the target is found.
Simple but inefficient for large datasets (O(n) time complexity).
6. Binary Search
Efficient searching algorithm for sorted arrays.
Divides the search space in half repeatedly (O(log n) time complexity).
