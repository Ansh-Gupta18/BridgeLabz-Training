### Week 5 Day 1 – Lambda Expressions & Method References in Java

- Focused on understanding functional-style programming in Java using lambda expressions and method references. Practiced writing concise, readable code by replacing anonymous classes with lambdas and explored how Java infers types using target typing.

Covered key concepts including:
- Lambda expression syntax (no parameter, single parameter, multiple parameters)
- Functional interfaces and target typing
- Type inference in lambda expressions
- Closures and effectively final variables
- Difference between lambda expressions and anonymous inner classes
- Using lambdas with Streams, Predicate, Comparator, and Runnable
