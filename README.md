Week 2 Day 1 – Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

Studied Procedural Programming and its limitations.

 Week 2 Day 2 – Constructors, Variables & Access Modifiers

📘 Topics Covered Learned about constructors and their role in object initialization:

Default constructors Parameterized constructors Constructor chaining using this() Copy constructors Explored instance variables vs class (static) variables:

Instance variables belong to individual objects. Static variables are shared across all objects of a class. Practiced instance methods vs static methods and their use cases.

Gained hands-on experience with access modifiers:

public protected private Understood how access levels affect visibility across classes and subclasses. 🔗 Code Link:https://github.com/Ansh-Gupta18/BridgeLabz-Training/tree/java-oops-practice/java-oops-practice/grc-codebase/JavaOopsConcepts/src/com/constructorandinstance/level1 👉 Week 2 Day 2 – Constructor & Access Modifiers

Week 2 Day 3 – Keywords & Scenario-Based Programming

📘 Topics Covered Learned and implemented important Java keywords:

this – to refer to current class instance variables and methods. static – to define class-level variables and methods. final – to restrict modification of variables, methods, and classes. Understood differences between:

this vs static Instance members vs static members Final variables vs non-final variables Solved scenario-based problems to strengthen real-world understanding:

Parking Lot Management System Phone Recharge Simulation Number Guessing Game Discount Calculation System Focused on:

Logical flow building Conditional statements (if-else, switch) Looping constructs Clean and readable code structure Improved debugging skills and code readability.

Week 2 Day 4 – Scenario-Based Design & Object Modeling

📘 Topics Covered Practiced real-world scenario-based problem solving using Object-Oriented Programming concepts.

Learned how to identify entities, attributes, and relationships from problem statements.

Designed and implemented object models before writing code.

Understood and applied different types of relationships:

Association – objects related but independent Aggregation – “has-a” relationship with independent lifecycles Composition – strong ownership and dependency Key Concepts Applied

Breaking real-world problems into: Classes Objects Responsibilities Mapping real-life scenarios into:

Class diagrams (conceptual understanding) Logical method responsibilities 🔗 Code Link:https://github.com/Ansh-Gupta18/BridgeLabz-Training/tree/java-oops-practice/java-oops-practice/grc-codebase/JavaOopsConcepts/src/com/objectmodelling 👉 Week 2 Day 4 - Object Modeling and Scenario-Based Question


Week 2 Day 5 – Inheritance & Types of Inheritance in Java

📘 Topics Covered Learned the concept of Inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming:

Reusing properties and behaviors of an existing class. Promoting code reusability and logical hierarchy. Understanding the extends keyword. Explored different types of inheritance supported in Java:

Single Inheritance – One child class inherits from one parent class. Multilevel Inheritance – A class derived from another derived class. Hierarchical Inheritance – Multiple subclasses inherit from a single parent class. Multiple Inheritance (via Interfaces) – Achieved using interfaces since Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes. Hybrid Inheritance (conceptual) – Combination of multiple and multilevel inheritance using interfaces. Practiced usage of:

super keyword to access parent class constructors and methods. Method overriding and runtime polymorphism. Accessing inherited members based on access modifiers. Understood important inheritance rules:

Constructors are not inherited. Private members are not directly accessible in child classes. Method overriding requires same method signature. final methods cannot be overridden. Implemented real-world examples such as:

Person → Waiter → Chef hierarchy Vehicle → Electrical Vehicle Student → Teacher → Staff Focused on:

Clean class hierarchy design Avoiding tight coupling Writing reusable and maintainable code 🔗 Code Link: https://github.com/Ansh-Gupta18/BridgeLabz-Training/tree/java-oops-practice/java-oops-practice/grc-codebase/JavaOopsConcepts/src/com/inheritance 👉 Week 2 Day 5 – Inheritance & Types of Inheritance
