### Week 6 day 1 – MySQL Indexing and Query Optimization


Learned MySQL Indexing concepts to improve database query performance and efficiency.


Covered:

- Purpose of indexing and its impact on SELECT, JOIN, and ORDER BY performance
- Types of indexes: Primary Key, Unique, Regular, Composite, Full-Text, and Covering Index
- How B-Tree indexes work and difference between Index Scan vs Table Scan
- Creating, viewing, renaming, and dropping indexes using CREATE INDEX and ALTER TABLE
