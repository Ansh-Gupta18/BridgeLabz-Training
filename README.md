### Week 5 Day 1 – Lambda Expressions & Method References in Java

- Focused on understanding functional-style programming in Java using lambda expressions and method references. Practiced writing concise, readable code by replacing anonymous classes with lambdas and explored how Java infers types using target typing.

Covered key concepts including:
- Lambda expression syntax (no parameter, single parameter, multiple parameters)
- Functional interfaces and target typing
- Type inference in lambda expressions
- Closures and effectively final variables
- Difference between lambda expressions and anonymous inner classes
- Using lambdas with Streams, Predicate, Comparator, and Runnable

### Week 5 day 2 – Java Stream API & Parallel Streams

- Practiced functional-style data processing using the Java Stream API.

Covered:
Stream pipeline structure (source → intermediate → terminal)
Intermediate operations: filter, map, sorted, distinct
Terminal operations: collect, forEach, count
Lazy evaluation and stateless vs stateful operations
Ordered vs unordered streams

Parallel Streams:
parallelStream() vs sequential stream
ForkJoinPool and multi-threaded execution
Order handling with forEachOrdered()
Performance considerations and best practices

Also practiced forEach() with lambdas and method references.
